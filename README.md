# astro-data
🛰️ An interactive space exploration dashboard visualizing the modern space race, launch costs, and orbital density. Built with GSAP and Flourish.

## 🔭 Project Overview
"astro-data" is a specialized data visualization platform designed to track and analyze the "New Space Race." The project focuses on how private entities like SpaceX have disrupted the traditional aerospace industry by lowering costs and increasing orbital accessibility.

### 📊 Key Research Insights:
1. **Launch Frequency:** Comparing historical state agency data vs. modern reusable rocket frequency.
2. **Economic Impact:** Mapping the price-per-kilogram drop for Low Earth Orbit (LEO) missions.
3. **Orbital Density:** A global scan of active satellite distribution and the rise of mega-constellations.

### 🛠️ Tech Stack:
- **Frontend:** HTML5, CSS3 (Custom Variables & Keyframes)
- **Animations:** GSAP 3.12 (ScrollTrigger & Timeline)
- **Data Visualization:** Flourish WebGL/Iframe integration
- **Design:** Cyberpunk HUD aesthetic with CRT-style post-processing
